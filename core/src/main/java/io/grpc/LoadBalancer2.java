/**
 * A pluggable component that receives resolved addresses from {@link NameResolver} and provides the
 * channel a usable subchannel when asked.  This is the new interface that will replace {@link
 * LoadBalancer}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Warning: this is still in developement.  Consult gRPC team before starting any related
 * work.</strong>
 *
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 *
 * <p>A LoadBalancer typically implements three interfaces:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link LoadBalancer2} is the main interface.  All methods on it are invoked sequentially
 *       from the Channel Executor.  It receives the results from the {@link NameResolver}, updates
 *       of subchannels' connectivity states, and the channel's request for the LoadBalancer to
 *       shutdown.</li>
 *   <li>{@link SubchannelPicker} does the actual load-balancing work.  It selects a
 *       {@link Subchannel} for each new RPC.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Factory} creates a new {@link LoadBalancer2} instance.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>{@link Helper} is implemented by gRPC library and provided to {@link Factory}. It provides
 * functionalities that a {@code LoadBalancer2} implementation would typically need.</li>
 *
 * <h3>Channel Executor</h3>
 *
 * <p>Channel Executor is an internal executor of the channel, which is used to serialize all the
 * callback methods on the {@link LoadBalancer2} interface, thus the balancer implementation doesn't
 * need to worry about synchronization among them.  However, the actual thread of the Channel
 * Executor is typically the network thread, thus following rules must be followed to prevent
 * blocking or even dead-locking in a network
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 *   <li><strong>Never block in Channel Executor</strong>.  The callback methods must return
 *   quickly.  Examples or work that must be avoided: CPU-intensive calculation, waiting on
 *   synchronization primitives, blocking I/O, blocking RPCs, etc.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>Avoid calling into other components with lock held</strong>.  Channel Executor may
 *   run callbacks under a lock, e.g., the transport lock of OkHttp.  If your LoadBalancer has a
 *   lock, holds the lock in a callback method (e.g., {@link #handleSubchannelState}) while calling
 *   into another class that may involve locks, be cautious of deadlock.  Generally you wouldn't
 *   need any locking in the LoadBalancer.</li>
 *
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>{@link Helper#runSerialized} allows you to schedule a task to be run in the Channel Executor.
 *
 * <h3>The canonical implementation pattern</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@link LoadBalancer2} keeps states like the latest addresses from NameResolver, the
 * Subchannel(s) and their latest connectivity states.  These states are mutated within the Channel
 * Executor.
 *
 * <p>A typical {@link SubchannelPicker} holds a snapshot of these states.  It may have its own
 * states, e.g., a picker from a round-robin load-balancer may keep a pointer to the next
 * Subchannel, which are typically mutated by multiple threads.  The picker should only mutate its
 * own state, and should not mutate or re-acquire the states of the LoadBalancer.  This way
 * the picker only needs to synchronize its own states, which is typically trivial.
 *
 * <p>When the LoadBalancer states changes, e.g., Subchannels has become or stopped being READY, and
 * we want subsequent RPCs to use the latest list of READY Subchannels, LoadBalancer would create
 * a new picker, which holds a snapshot of the latest Subchannel list.
 *
 * <p>No synchronization should be necessary between LoadBalancer and its pickers if you follow
 * the pattern above.  It may be possible to implement in a different way, but that would usually
 * result in more complicated threading.
